# MedRAG — Medical Literature Q&A with RAG

An independent learning project exploring Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), 
LangChain, vector databases, FastAPI, and Docker — built to develop hands-on 
skills in modern AI/ML engineering and GenAI application development.

---

## What This Project Does

MedRAG is a domain-specific question-answering system that answers questions 
grounded in medical research papers. Instead of relying on an LLM's training 
data, it retrieves relevant passages from a local document collection and uses 
them as context for generation — ensuring answers are grounded in the actual 
source material.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Docker Desktop
- Ollama installed and running locally

### 1. Install Ollama and pull the model
```bash
brew install ollama
ollama pull llama3.2
ollama serve
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Add your documents
Place PDF files in the `data/` directory.

### 4. Build the vector index
```bash
python ingest.py
```

### 5. Run locally
```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

### 6. Run with Docker
```bash
docker build -t medrag .
docker run -p 8000:8000 medrag
```

## Usage

**Query endpoint:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is Lock-Release Pretraining?"}'
```

**Health check:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

**Example response:**
```json
{
  "answer": "Lock-Release Pretraining is a strategy that alternates between 
  freezing and unfreezing model components during cyclic multi-dataset training, 
  designed to stabilize multi-task optimization and prevent task-specific 
  overfitting across heterogeneous annotation types."
}
```
